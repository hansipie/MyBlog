## Papimathic Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** June 16, 2025
**Developer:** Hansi PIERRE
**Company:** ansicode

This Privacy Policy outlines how the Papimathic mobile application ("the App") handles user information.

---

### Data Collection

The Papimathic App is designed to help children learn math. While the App itself **does not directly collect any personal data** from users, such as names, email addresses, or unique device identifiers managed by us, we do use **Google AdMob**, a third-party advertising service, to display advertisements within the App.

AdMob may collect certain information to provide and improve its advertising services. This information can include:

* **Device identifiers** (e.g., Android Advertising ID).
* **IP address**.
* **Device type and operating system**.
* **Information about user interactions with advertisements** (e.g., clicks, impressions).
* **Other data** related to user activity on ads.

This data is collected by AdMob for the purpose of:

* Measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.
* Preventing fraudulent activity.
* Performing advertising-related analytics.

### Data Sharing

Since the Papimathic App does not directly collect personal data, we do not share any such data with third parties.

However, by integrating Google AdMob, certain data (as described above) may be **shared with Google** and its advertising partners. This sharing is solely for the purpose of enabling advertising services and is governed by Google's Privacy Policy. We do not independently share any personal data collected by our App with any external entities, organizations, or companies.

For more information on how Google AdMob collects and processes data, please refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

### Children's Privacy

The Papimathic App is intended for educational use, including by children. Consistent with our commitment to privacy and in compliance with regulations such as the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** and the **Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)**, we have configured our AdMob implementation to **serve non-personalized ads only**.

This means that all ad requests from our App are treated as child-directed. AdMob will **not collect or use personal data for the purpose of personalized advertising** for users of the Papimathic App, ensuring a safe and private learning environment free from targeted advertising for our young users.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. We encourage users to periodically review this Privacy Policy for any updates.
